@model NGM.Forum.Models.ThreadPart

    @Html.LabelFor(m => m.Title, T("Title"))
    <input type="text" id="Routable_Title" class="large text" name="Routable.Title" value="@Model.Title" />
    @*
        This didn't work because it was prepending Thread_ to the input's name
        @Html.TextBox("Routable.Title", Model.Title, new { @class = "large text" })
    *@

        This is the original. It wasn't working 100% correct because it would update Thread.Title
        but then reset the title to null when RoutePartDriver.TryUpdateModel was executed after.
        Maybe someone else has some insight on how to get it to work correctly?
